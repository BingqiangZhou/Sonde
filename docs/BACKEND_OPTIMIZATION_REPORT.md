## Verification Commands

### 1. Docker Configuration Validation
```bash
cd docker
docker-compose config
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

### 2. Health Checks
```bash
# Basic health
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health | jq .

# Readiness check
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health/ready | jq .

# Database pool metrics
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health/db | jq .

# Expected: pool_size=10, max_overflow=15, capacity=25
```

### 3. Resource Limits Verification
```bash
docker stats --no-stream
docker inspect sonde_backend | jq '.[0].HostConfig.LogConfig'
```

### 4. Prometheus Metrics
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/metrics/prometheus | head -50
```

### 5. Query Analysis (Development)
```bash
# Check logs for N+1 warnings
docker-compose logs backend | grep "Potential N+1"
```

### 6. Cache Warmup
```bash
# Check startup logs
docker-compose logs backend | grep -i "cache warm"
```

- Proper exception handling with `return_exceptions=True`

**Impact**:
- Daily reports now process multiple users concurrently
- Estimated 5-10x speedup for large user batches
- Isolated sessions prevent transaction conflicts

### 4.3 Parallel Stats Service Queries

- `invalidate_cached_stats()`: Parallel cache invalidation
- Added `asyncio` import for `asyncio.gather`

**Impact**:
- Stats endpoint latency reduced from 3 sequential operations to 1 parallel batch
- Cache invalidation no longer blocks on sequential calls

### 4.4 Parallel Highlight Extraction
**Files Modified**:
- `backend/app/domains/podcast/services/highlight_extraction_service.py`

**Changes**:
- `extract_pending_highlights()`: Concurrent episode processing
- Semaphore limits concurrency to 5 simultaneous extractions
- Isolated sessions per episode prevent transaction conflicts
- Result aggregation for success/failure/skipped counts

**Impact**:
- Highlight extraction throughput improved with concurrent processing
- Better resource utilization during batch operations
